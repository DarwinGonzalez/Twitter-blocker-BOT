# Testing Twitter bot
Test twitter API blocking users from your twitter that have "The flag of Spain icon" in their username. You can fully customize who you want to block. **DO NOT stand b*******s, block them!**

*PD*: in order to use this app you will have to configure the *./config* file parameters with your twitter API credentials.
